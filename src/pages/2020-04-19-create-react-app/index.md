Even though create-react-app is one of the most used tools for starting React projects, we don’t see most of the configuration that we need to do for it. When we need to modify that config, we are not sure how to do it. This tutorial will walk you through the normal steps that I’ve seen it’s needed for a high-level React project (with tests, linter, and best-practices). My objective is that you can understand what’s needed for creating a react app, and modify your create-react-app configuration or legacy projects.
